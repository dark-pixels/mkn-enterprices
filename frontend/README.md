# MKN Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "d:/pixels projects/MKN/mkn-enterprices/mkn-enterprices/frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server (open shown URL).
- `npm run build` creates an optimized production build.
- `npm run preview` serves the built app locally.

Notes:
- Tailwind is already configured via `tailwind.config.cjs` and `postcss.config.cjs`.
- If you prefer `yarn` or `pnpm`, use those commands instead of `npm`.
